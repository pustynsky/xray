## Real-World Use Cases

### 🐛 1. Debugging — Stack Trace Investigation

**Situation:** You receive a production stack trace.

```
NullReferenceException at OrderManager.ProcessOrderAsync(OrderManager.cs:145)
```

<table>
<tr><th>❌ Without xray</th><th>✅ With xray</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```
search_files "ProcessOrderAsync"  → 46s
read_file OrderManager.cs         → 2s
search_files "calls ProcessOrder" → 46s
read_file caller file              → 2s
───────────────────────────────────
Total: ~2 minutes + manual analysis
```

</td><td>

```json
// 1. Find method at line 145 (1ms)
{"file": ["OrderManager.cs"], "containsLine": 145}
→ ProcessOrderAsync (lines 120-160), class: OrderManager

// 2. Trace callers (~3-11ms)
{"method": ["ProcessOrderAsync"], "class": "OrderManager", "depth": 3}
→ OrderController.CreateOrder (line 56)
    └── OrderManager.ProcessOrderAsync (line 145)
        └── PaymentService.ChargeAsync (line 89)

// 3. Read source inline (1ms)
{"name": ["ProcessOrderAsync"], "includeBody": true}
→ full method source code returned
───────────────────────────────────
Total: 3 milliseconds
```

</td></tr>
</table>

**Speedup: ~20,000×**

---

### 🏗️ 2. Understanding Unfamiliar Code

**Situation:** You need to work on a module you've never seen before.

```json
// Step 1: Map all classes (1ms)
{"name": ["PaymentModule"], "maxResults": 50, "includeBody": false}
→ PaymentService, IPaymentGateway, PaymentValidator, PaymentController...

// Step 2: Trace call chain from API to data layer (~3-11ms)
{"method": ["ProcessPayment"], "class": "PaymentService", "depth": 5, "direction": "down"}
→ PaymentService.ProcessPayment
    ├── PaymentValidator.ValidateRequest
    ├── PaymentGateway.ChargeAsync
    │   └── HttpClient.PostAsync
    └── OrderRepository.UpdateStatusAsync
        └── DbContext.SaveChangesAsync

// Step 3: Find all implementations (1ms)
{"baseType": "IPaymentGateway"}
→ StripeGateway, PayPalGateway, MockPaymentGateway

// Step 4: Assess scale (1ms, 46 tokens)
{"terms": ["PaymentService"], "countOnly": true}
→ 23 files, 47 occurrences
```

**Time saved:** ~40 minutes of manual exploration → **2 minutes**

### 📝 3. Code Review — PR Review Assistance

**Situation:** Reviewing a PR — need to understand blast radius.

<table>
<tr><th>❌ Without xray</th><th>✅ With xray</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```
"Who else calls this method?"
search_files → 46s
read_file    → 2s
read_file    → 2s
(repeat 3x)  → 3 min

"All implementations?"
search_files → 46s
read_file    → 2s

"Feature flag used elsewhere?"
search_files → 46s
───────────────────
Total: ~8 minutes
```

</td><td>

```json
// "Who else calls this?" (~3-11ms)
{"method": ["UpdateOrder"], "class": "OrderService", "depth": 2}
→ 3 callers found in call tree

// "All implementations?" (1ms)
{"baseType": "IOrderService"}
→ OrderService, OrderServiceV2, MockOrderService

// "Feature flag elsewhere?" (1ms)
{"terms": ["EnableNewPricing"], "substring": true}
→ 7 files, including config + code
───────────────────
Total: <3 milliseconds
```

</td></tr>
</table>

---

### 🔄 4. Safe Refactoring

**Situation:** Rename a method — must find ALL usage sites, including compound identifiers.

```json
// Find all mentions including compound names (1ms)
// e.g., DeleteOrderCacheEntry, m_orderService, IOrderService
{"terms": ["OrderService"], "substring": true, "showLines": true, "contextLines": 2}
→ 34 files, 89 occurrences (with surrounding code)

// Confirm all callers (~3-11ms)
{"method": ["ProcessOrder"], "class": "OrderService", "depth": 5}
→ full caller tree

// Find DI registrations (5ms)
{"terms": ["IOrderService","OrderService"], "mode": "and"}
→ 3 files where both appear together
```

**Key advantage:** Substring search catches `DeleteOrderServiceCacheEntry` and `m_orderService` — names that exact-token search misses.

---

### 📊 5. Task Scope Estimation

**Situation:** "How long will this take?"

```json
// How many files? (1ms, ~46 tokens in response)
{"terms": ["FeatureX"], "countOnly": true}
→ 12 files, 31 occurrences

// How complex? (1ms)
{"parent": ["FeatureXManager"], "kind": ["method"]}
→ 14 methods

// How deep? (~3-11ms)
{"method": ["ExecuteFeatureX"], "class": "FeatureXManager", "depth": 5}
→ call tree shows 3 layers deep, touches 2 external services
```

**Result:** In 30 seconds you know: 12 files, 14 methods, 3 layers deep → "2-3 day task."

---

### 🧪 6. Writing Tests

```json
// Read the code under test (1ms)
{"name": ["ProcessOrder"], "parent": ["OrderManager"], "includeBody": true}
→ full method source returned inline

// Discover all dependencies to mock (1ms)
{"parent": ["OrderManager"], "kind": ["field"]}
→ IPaymentService, IOrderRepository, ILogger, IValidator

// Find existing test patterns (35ms)
{"pattern": ["OrderManagerTest"]}
→ tests/OrderManagerTest.cs, tests/OrderManagerIntegrationTest.cs

// Read test examples inline (1ms)
{"file": ["OrderManagerTest.cs"], "kind": ["method"], "includeBody": true}
→ all test methods with source code
```

---

### 🔍 7. Configuration & Dependency Discovery

```json
// All NuGet packages (5ms)
{"terms": ["PackageReference"], "ext": ["csproj"], "showLines": true}

// All feature flags in configs (3ms)
{"terms": ["FeatureFlag"], "ext": ["xml","config","json"]}

// Who depends on my project? (5ms)
{"terms": ["MyProject"], "ext": ["csproj"], "mode": "and"}
```

---

### 🕵️ 8. When Was This Error Introduced?

**Situation:** A new error message `"Entry not found for tenant"` appears in production logs. You need to find exactly when and by whom it was introduced.

```json
// Step 1: Verify you're on the right branch (45ms)
{"repo": "."}
→ branch=main, behindMain=0, fetchAge="2 hours ago" ✓

// Step 2: Find which files contain the text (~1ms)
{"terms": ["Entry not found for tenant"], "phrase": true, "showLines": true}
→ src/Services/EntryService.cs, line 87

// Step 3: Blame the exact lines to find who introduced it (~200ms)
{"repo": ".", "file": ["src/Services/EntryService.cs"], "startLine": 85, "endLine": 90}
→ line 87: commit abc123de by Alice on 2025-01-10

// Step 4: See who maintains the file (< 1ms from cache)
{"repo": ".", "path": "src/Services/EntryService.cs", "top": 3}
→ Alice (42 commits), Bob (17 commits), Carol (5 commits)

// Step 5: Get full commit context (~2s)
{"repo": ".", "file": ["src/Services/EntryService.cs"], "from": "2025-01-09", "to": "2025-01-11"}
→ full diff showing the exact lines added
```

**Tools used:** `xray_branch_status` → `xray_grep` → `xray_git_blame` → `xray_git_authors` → `xray_git_diff`
**Total time:** ~3 seconds. Without xray: ~10 minutes of `git log`, `git blame`, manual searching.

## Case Study: Architecture Deep-Dive in 5 Minutes

### Context

We used xray to reverse-engineer a **large async API system** spanning **3,800+ lines** across multiple layers, which we had never seen before.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[REST Client] -->|POST /trigger| GW[API Gateway]
    GW --> CTRL[API Controller]
    CTRL --> MGR[Business Logic Manager]
    MGR -->|Insert job| DB[(SQL Database)]
    MGR -->|Schedule| BUS[Service Bus]
    BUS -->|Picks up job| WS[Worker Service]
    WS --> MGR2[Manager - Run Scan]
    MGR2 -->|Query data| DB
    MGR2 -->|Get metadata| ENG[Database Engine - DMV queries]
    MGR2 -->|Read cached schemas| BLOB[(Blob Storage)]
    MGR2 -->|Write results| BLOB

    Client2[REST Client] -->|GET /status| GW2[API Gateway]
    GW2 --> CTRL2[Controller]
    CTRL2 --> MGR3[Manager]
    MGR3 -->|Check job status| DB

    Client3[REST Client] -->|GET /result| GW3[API Gateway]
    GW3 --> CTRL3[Controller]
    CTRL3 --> MGR4[Manager]
    MGR4 -->|Read result blob| BLOB
```

### What we discovered in ~5 minutes

Using only `xray_definitions`, `xray_callers`, and `xray_grep`:

1. **Found all API endpoints** — identified async 3-step polling: POST trigger → GET status → GET result
2. **Traced the full async job flow**: Controller → Manager → Job Scheduler → Worker Service → blob write
3. **Mapped the core data retrieval** (~400 lines): DB queries, lineage extraction, parallel schema loading
4. **Traced call chains** from controller down to database engine connections
5. **Discovered the caching pipeline**: engine queries → discovery service → blob cache → API reads cache
6. **Identified sub-object support**: only 2 of 7 entity types support detailed metadata
7. **Built complete architecture diagrams** with Mermaid

### Tools used and timing

```json
// Find controller endpoints (1ms)
{"parent": ["ApiController"], "kind": ["method"]}
→ 5 endpoints: PostTrigger, GetStatus, GetResult, GetModified, GetPrerequisites

// Read method bodies (1ms)
{"name": ["PostTrigger"], "parent": ["ApiController"], "includeBody": true}
→ full source: validates input → checks throttling → creates job → schedules → returns 202

// Trace who calls the worker method (~3-11ms)
{"method": ["RunScanAsync"], "class": "Manager", "depth": 3, "direction": "up"}
→ WorkerService.RunScanRequest → Manager.RunScanAsync

// Find all related classes (1ms)
{"name": ["DomainModule"], "kind": ["class"], "maxResults": 50}
→ 41 classes across controller, manager, storage, contracts layers

// Read interface contract (1ms)
{"name": ["IManager"], "kind": ["interface"], "includeBody": true}
→ 7 methods: PostScan, GetStatus, GetResult, GetModified, RunScan, CheckThrottle...

// Trace metadata source (1ms per hop, 3 hops)
Manager.GetSchema → SchemaStorage.GetFromBlob → DB.GetBlobReference
→ discovered: schemas are pre-cached in blob, not queried live
```

**Total search time: <10ms.** The rest was reading and reasoning.

### Key insight

All of this was done **without reading any documentation** — purely by navigating code structure through xray tools. The AST index + call graph + content search, combined with an AI agent's reasoning, turned a multi-day exploration into a 5-minute conversation.

## Vision: Future Ideas

### 🔧 Near-term

**Automatic Developer Onboarding** — A bot that answers "I got a bug in CacheManager, where do I start?" by finding the class, its callers, its dependencies, and related tests in 30 seconds.

**PR Impact Analysis** — On every PR, run `xray_callers` depth=5 on every changed method. Generate: "This change affects 3 API endpoints and 47 callers."

**Auto-Generated Architecture Docs** — Given a namespace, auto-map all classes, call trees, and generate Mermaid diagrams.

### 🚀 Mid-term

**Live Architecture Map** — Interactive dependency visualization from the full AST index. Heatmap of co-change frequency (correlating with git history).

**Code Archaeology** — "Tell me the story of this feature" by combining xray with git blame/log.

**Smart Code Review** — Auto-detect pattern violations: "47 other places wrap this in a logging scope — this PR doesn't."

**Tech Debt Tracker** — Find dead code (methods with zero callers), God classes >3000 lines, unused feature flags.

### 🤯 Moonshots

**AI Migration Planner** — Map all DI registrations and dependencies, generate a migration plan with effort estimates.

**Cross-Repo Search** — One query across all repos: frontend → API → backend → database.

**"Explain This Outage"** — Stack trace → method → callers → feature flags → throttling rules → root cause summary.

**"What If" Simulator** — "What breaks if I delete method X?" → full blast radius with affected tests.

## Why xray Makes All of This Possible

**AST index + call graph + inverted text index in one tool** at **sub-millisecond to low single-digit milliseconds per query** across **65K+ files**.

Without it, each scenario requires minutes of ripgrep per query, manual file navigation, or heavyweight tools like Roslyn/CodeQL with long cold starts.

xray provides capabilities that previously required an IDE with a fully-loaded solution — but accessible via MCP in the working flow of an AI agent.
